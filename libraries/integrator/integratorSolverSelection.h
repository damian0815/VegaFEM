// Selects which solver is used by the integrator library.
// Exactly one of PARDISO, SPOOLES, PCG should be enabled.
// Note: for PARDISO or SPOOLES, the selected solver must be installed and its
//       availability also set in libraries/sparseSolvers/sparseSolverAvailability.h .
//       The PCG solver (Jacobi-preconditioned Conjugate Gradients) is included 
//       with Vega and therefore always available.
