Installation and compilation instructions are available in the PDF User's Manual, 
located in the "documentation" subfolder.

Quick start, main functionality (Linux, Mac OS X):
==================================================

1. Go to the subfolder "Makefile-headers", and launch either "./selectLinux" or "./selectMacOSX".
2. Go to the subfolder "utilities/interactiveDeformableSimulator" and type "make".
3. Go to the subfolder "examples/turtle" and launch "./run_turtle". LMB = apply force on model, RMB = camera movement. You can also try "examples/asianDragon" and other examples of course.

You can perform steps 1., 2., by running "./build".

Quick start, model reduction (Linux, Mac OS X):
===============================================

1. Satisfy all the dependencies. See the documentation, "Model Reduction Dependencies". 
2. Edit "Makefile-headers/Makefile-header": fill in the sections "needed for model reduction", "needed for reducedDynamicSolver-rt", and optionally, "needed for LargeModalDeformationFactory".
3. Build main functionality (above). Important: you must build the main functionality with the Intel MKL Pardiso solver support enabled. It is disabled by default. See the documentation ("Compiling Vega: Model Reduction"). .
4. Launch "./buildModelReduction". 
5. Go to the subfolder "utilities/reducedDynamicSolver-rt" and launch "./run_A". LMB = apply force on model, RMB = camera movement
