== vv LEAST COMPLEX vv ==
  208 vertices: beam <== trivial
  347 vertices: turtle <== very good start (non-homogeneous material properties: backshell is made of harder material)
  347 vertices: orthotropic turtle <== demonstrates real-time orthotropic materials
  959 vertices: asianDragon <== demonstrates unconstrained (free-fly) motion; also demonstrates Mooney-Rivlin material
 4000 vertices: simpleBridge
 9875 vertices: towerCrane <== runs at 2 fps on our machines
25620 vertices: tube <== offline orthotropic
47736 vertices: dragon <== offline
